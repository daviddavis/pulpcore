# Correlation ID

Pulp provides support for correlation ids that are helpful to correlate requests to log messages and
tasks. Correlation IDs are autogenerated by default but can also be set via pulp-cli or sent as a
header with each request. Correlation ids are also returned as a header in the response and are
recorded in the `logging_cid` field of tasks.

To view the correlation id for an API request, see the `Correlation-ID` header in the response:

```
$ http POST ${SERVER_ADDR}${REPO_HREF}sync/
...
Correlation-ID: 47ebc1b6a77642e2b9eca645d3277aa5
...
```

All log messages in Pulp that are correlated with the request will be prepended with the correlation
id:

```
pulp [47ebc1b6a77642e2b9eca645d3277aa5]: 127.0.0.1 - admin [31/Jan/2025:20:09:34 +0000] "POST /pulp/api/v3/repositories/file/file/0194b8e9-5425-799b-ad0a-86c71e160158/sync/ HTTP/1.1" 202 67 "-" "HTTPie/3.2.1"
pulp [47ebc1b6a77642e2b9eca645d3277aa5]: pulpcore.tasking.tasks:INFO: Starting task 0194bdfb-aa1e-72fb-b3bd-8e6e3f36dedb in domain: default
pulp [47ebc1b6a77642e2b9eca645d3277aa5]: pulpcore.tasking.tasks:INFO: Task completed 0194bdfb-aa1e-72fb-b3bd-8e6e3f36dedb in domain: default
```

Any task that was executed will also have the correlation id set on its `logging_cid` field:

```
$ pulp task list --cid 47ebc1b6a77642e2b9eca645d3277aa5
...
    "logging_cid": "47ebc1b6a77642e2b9eca645d3277aa5",
...
```

## Setting correlation id

It's possible to set the correlation id using the pulp-cli:

```bash
$ pulp --cid 1646c5896b48414698a260374dcb6849 file repository sync --name myfilerepo
```

Or when sending a request directly to Pulp:

```
$ http ${SERVER_ADDR}${REPO_HREF}sync/ Correlation-ID:1646c5896b48414698a260374dcb6849
...
Correlation-ID: 1646c5896b48414698a260374dcb6849
```

By default Pulp expects a 32 character UUID to be sent via a "Correlation-ID" header. However,
support for correlation id is highly customizable in terms of what headers Pulp uses and what
formats it accepts. For information how to customize correlation id header name and format, see [the
settings documentation](site:pulpcore/docs/admin/reference/settings/#django_guid).
